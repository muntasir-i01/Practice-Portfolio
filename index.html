                    Tech 3D Prints Private Limited is one of the pioneers in the architectural model making industry in
                    Oman. Setup in
                    2010, the company has unique value systems that have created an unparalleled name with the Real

                    Developers,
                    Engineers and Architects. <br> <br>

                    We specialize in producing commercial and residential architectural models, industrial models,
                    exhibition models,
                    mechanical and heavy engineering models, R&D models, prototype models and sculpture models. Tech 3D
                    models have assisted
                    several architects and project developers to stand out from the growing competition by showcasing
                    their
                    designs and
                    ideas in a visually appealing way. <br> <br>

                    Our architectural 3D modeling can be used for large scale model making, a single building,
                    massing/spatial/detailed
                    models or shadow studies. Geographic Information Systems 3D data can be printed to show actual city
                    landscapes, and
                    proposed buildings can be added to show the effect on a city’s skyline.
